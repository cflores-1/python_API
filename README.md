Part I.
# WeatherPy

Observations:
- Based on the plots with cloudiness vs latitude and wind speed vs latitude we can conclude that there is no relationship between them. 
- This activity follows the logic that the closer you get to the equator the warmer the temperature becomes. This is seen on the linear regression plots with the temperature vs latitude relationship.

Part II.
# VacationPY

Observations:
- Based on my preference of temperature most ideal vacation spots were located in Africa.
